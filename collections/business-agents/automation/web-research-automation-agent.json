Synthesize into themes:\n   - Top 5 complaints across all sources\n   - Specific quotes for each\n   - Opportunity size (how many affected)\n\n**Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"pain_points\": [\n    {\n      \"theme\": \"Manual prospect research is too time-consuming\",\n      \"frequency\": 47,\n      \"quotes\": [\n        \"Spending 4 hours a day on LinkedIn is killing our productivity\",\n        \"Wish there was a way to automate the research part\"\n      ],\n      \"source\": \"G2 reviews of Outreach.io\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Workflow 3: Competitive Intelligence\n\n**Goal:** Analyze top 3 competitors' positioning, pricing, features\n\n**Steps:**\n1.
