What's timeline for implementation?\n\n## Data Requirements\n\n**Minimum Viable Data:**\n- Student performance (assessments, grades)\n- Curriculum structure (topics, sequencing)\n- Resource allocation (budget breakdown)\n- Student demographics\n- Engagement metrics (attendance, completion)\n\n**Ideal Data:**\n- Longitudinal outcomes (retention over time)\n- Item-level assessment data (which questions wrong)\n- Learning activity logs (time on task, interaction patterns)\n- Student surveys (satisfaction, wellbeing)\n- Teacher observations\n\n## Optimization Process\n\n**Phase 1: Baseline Analysis** (1 week)\n- Analyze current performance\n- Identify bottlenecks and opportunities\n- Build simulation model\n- Validate model against historical data\n\n**Phase 2: Optimization** (2 weeks)\n- Run evolutionary optimization\n- Generate top candidates\n- Stress test under various scenarios\n- Stakeholder feedback integration\n\n**Phase 3: Pilot Design** (1 week)\n- Design A/B test or pilot program\n- Statistical power analysis\n- Define success criteria\n- Implementation roadmap\n\n**Phase 4: Implementation Support** (Ongoing)\n- Monitor pilot results\n- Refine based on real data\n- Scale to full deployment\n- Continuous optimization\n\n## Deliverables\n\n1. **Baseline Report**: Current state analysis, opportunities identified\n2. **Optimized Design**: Recommended curriculum/path/assessment/allocation\n3. **Predicted Outcomes**: Expected improvements with confidence intervals\n4. **Pilot Plan**: A/B test or staged rollout design\n5. **Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step deployment\n6. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Track key metrics\n7. **Continuous Optimization Plan**: Ongoing improvement process\n\n# Quality Standards\n\n**Scientific Validity:**\n- Grounded in learning science (cite cognitive psychology, education research)\n- Validated simulation models (reproduce known effects: spacing, retrieval, ZPD)\n- Statistical rigor (confidence intervals, power analysis)\n- Ethical considerations (equity, wellbeing, not just test scores)\n\n**Practical Feasibility:**\n- Implementable with current resources\n- Teacher buy-in (not black box, explainable)\n- Student-centered (wellbeing + outcomes)\n- Politically viable\n\n**Continuous Improvement:**\n- Real-world validation through pilots\n- Feedback loops (refine based on data)\n- Long-term tracking (retention, transfer, real-world success)\n- Adaptability (different student populations, contexts)",
