## SCRIPT 1: SALES & MARKETING AUTOMATION (5 min)

### HOOK (0:00-0:30)
```
[SCREEN: Results dashboard showing 15x meeting increase]

"What if your sales team could book 15x more meetings... 
without hiring more SDRs?

Hi, I'm [name] from Universal Optimization.

In the next 5 minutes, I'll show you how AI-powered sales automation 
handles prospect research, email writing, deliverability optimization, 
and response classification - completely hands-off.

The same evolutionary AI that beat state-of-the-art in drug discovery.
Now solving YOUR sales challenges.

Let's dive in."
```

### PROBLEM (0:30-1:30)
```
[SCREEN: Animation of overwhelmed SDR drowning in spreadsheets]

"Here's the typical sales workflow:

Step 1: Manually research prospects on LinkedIn (20 hours/week)
Step 2: Write 'personalized' emails (actually just {{firstName}} merge tags)
Step 3: Send via tool that doesn't optimize deliverability (60% end up in spam)
Step 4: Manually check responses, route to AEs

Result? 2% response rate. 40 hours/week of grunt work. 
And your sales team spends more time on data entry than SELLING.

Sound familiar?"

[SCREEN: Stat overlays]
- 40 hours/week on research
- 60% emails go to spam
- 2% response rate
- Only 5 meetings booked/week

"There's a better way."
```

### SOLUTION OVERVIEW (1:30-2:30)
```
[SCREEN: Platform overview - 4 AI agents]

"Introducing AI Sales Automation Suite - 4 agents that replace your entire workflow:

Agent 1: LinkedIn Prospect Researcher
- Scrapes LinkedIn for ideal prospects
- Extracts pain points, trigger events, recent posts
- 100 prospects/hour (vs 5 manually)

Agent 2: Personalized Email Writer
- Generates truly personalized emails (not templates)
- References pain points, trigger events
- Optimizes for response rate

Agent 3: Deliverability Validator
- Pre-send optimization (90%+ inbox placement)
- Provider-specific adjustments
- Spam filter testing

Agent 4: Response Classifier
- AI reads every response
- Categories: Interested / Not Interested / Objection
- Auto-routes to AE or nurture sequence

All four agents run 24/7. Completely automated. Continuously improving."

## SCRIPT 2: CLIMATE TECH OPTIMIZATION (5 min)

### HOOK (0:00-0:30)
```
[SCREEN: Carbon capture facility with efficiency meters]

"What if you could capture 20% more CO2...
using the SAME energy, SAME equipment, SAME team?

That's $2-5 million more in carbon credit value per year.

Hi, I'm [name]. In the next 5 minutes, I'll show you how 
evolutionary AI optimizes carbon capture processes, 
renewable energy grids, and sustainable agriculture.

The same technology that beat state-of-the-art in drug discovery.
Now tackling climate challenges.

Let's save the planet - profitably."
```

### PROBLEM (0:30-1:30)
```
[SCREEN: Efficiency gap visualization]

"Here's the challenge facing climate tech:

Your carbon capture process is at 65% efficiency.
Theoretical maximum is 95%.
That's a 30-point gap worth MILLIONS.

Current approach to close the gap?
- Manual parameter tweaks (months of testing)
- Academic partnerships (years to results)
- Trial and error (expensive, slow)

Meanwhile:
- Carbon credit prices are rising ($100+/tonne)
- Competitors are optimizing faster
- Your efficiency is stuck

Every percentage point of efficiency = $200k-$500k/year in value.

You're leaving millions on the table."

[SCREEN: Cost of inefficiency calculation]
65% efficiency @ $100/tonne CO2 = $6.5M/year
85% efficiency @ $100/tonne CO2 = $8.5M/year
Opportunity cost = $2M/year
```

### SOLUTION OVERVIEW (1:30-2:30)
```
[SCREEN: Evolutionary AI diagram]

"Introducing Climate Optimization Suite:

Instead of manual trial-and-error, we use evolutionary AI to:
1. Model your capture process (temperature, pressure, solvents, flow rates)
2. Generate thousands of parameter combinations
3. Test in simulation (fast, cheap)
4. Evolve toward optimal solution
5. Deploy winners to real facility

Timeline: 6-8 weeks from data upload to optimized process.
Expected improvement: 15-25% efficiency gain.

The same algorithm that optimized drug molecules (15% better than SOTA)
now optimizes YOUR carbon capture chemistry."

[SCREEN: Before/After process diagrams]
```

### DEMO (2:30-4:00)
```
[SCREEN: Platform walkthrough]

"Real example: CarbonTech Inc (anonymized pilot customer)

Challenge: DAC process stuck at 68% capture efficiency

Step 1: Upload process data
[Show data upload interface]
- Current parameters (temperature, pressure, solvent mix)
- Constraints (equipment limits, safety margins)
- Success metric: CO2 captured per kWh

Step 2: Define optimization goal
[Show goal configuration]
- Primary: Maximize capture efficiency
- Secondary: Minimize energy consumption
- Constraint: Stay within equipment tolerances

Step 3: Launch optimization
[Show evolution running]
- Generation 1: Testing 100 parameter combinations
- Generation 10: Best solution at 72% (+4% vs baseline)
- Generation 25: Best solution at 76% (+8%)
- Generation 50: Best solution at 81% (+13%)

Step 4: Validation & deployment
[Show results analysis]
- Simulated improvement: 13% efficiency gain
- Lab validation: 11% confirmed
- Full-scale deployment: 12% actual improvement

Result: 68% → 80% capture efficiency in 6 weeks.
Value: $1.8M more in carbon credits annually.
ROI on $60k pilot investment: 30x in year one."

[SCREEN: Case studies]

"But this is climate tech - does AI actually work?

Case Study 1: DAC Company (anonymized)
- Baseline: 68% capture efficiency
- Optimized: 80% (+12%)
- Timeline: 6 weeks
- Annual value: +$1.8M

Case Study 2: Renewable Energy Grid
