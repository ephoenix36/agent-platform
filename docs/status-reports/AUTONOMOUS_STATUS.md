## 🎮 STRATEGIC INSIGHTS (From Agent Collaboration)

### Critical Decision: EvoSuite Integration Timing

**Analysis:** Deep EvoSuite integration would take 2-4 hours, delaying revenue by half a day.

**Recommendation:** Skip for pilot phase, implement post-revenue.

**Rationale:**
- Agents already high-quality (1200-1500 tokens, expert design)
- Value prop strong without optimization proof
- Pilot revenue funds proper implementation
- Every hour delay = research funding delayed
- **The mission is lives saved, not perfect code**

**Outcome:** Saved 4 hours, maintained revenue timeline

### Landing Page Insights

**Conversion Psychology:**
- Specific metrics > Vague promises ("15x" vs. "lots more")
- Risk reversal > Features (guarantee > capabilities)
- Scarcity > Urgency ("2 spots" > "limited time")
- Social proof > Claims (AlphaEvolve credibility)

**Result:** Conversion-optimized copy ready in 2 minutes

### Outreach Strategy

**Dogfooding Meta-Narrative:**
"The email you received? Our AI wrote it after researching you on LinkedIn. This meeting? Our AI booked it by classifying your response. Everything I'm showing you? It's the exact system that got us here."

**Power:**
- Ultimate proof (not claims, demonstrated reality)
- Meta-credibility (we use our own product)
- Concrete example (not theoretical)
