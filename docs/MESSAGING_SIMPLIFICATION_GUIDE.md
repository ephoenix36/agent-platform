# Landing Page Messaging Simplification

## Advisor Feedback: "The Outsider"

**Current Problems:**
- Too much jargon: "evolutionary AI", "strategy variants", "RSC"
- Value proposition buried in technical details  
- Not immediately clear what the platform does
- Too complex for busy executives

**5-Second Clarity Test:**
Can a non-technical buyer understand what this does in 5 seconds?
**Current:** ❌ No
**Target:** ✅ Yes

## Messaging Framework

### Before (Technical/Jargon-Heavy)
- "Evolutionary AI optimization platform"
- "Strategy variants compete through natural selection"
- "RSC architecture with composable agents"
- "Genetic algorithms for continuous improvement"

### After (Simple/Clear/Benefit-Focused)
- "Automate and improve your [domain] without replacing your team"
- "Smart automation that learns what works and does more of it"
- "15-75% improvement in [metric] within [timeframe]"
- "Your team focuses on strategy, we handle optimization"

- Overwhelming for first-time visitors
- Pricing ranges vary wildly ($2.5K - $15K)
- No anchor or "most popular" guidance

### Proposed Approach

**Option 1: Tiered Pricing (Domain-Agnostic)**
```
STARTER - $2,500/month
- 1 optimization domain
- Up to 10,000 decisions/month
- Email support
- Monthly reporting

GROWTH - $5,000/month  ⭐ MOST POPULAR
- 2 optimization domains
- Up to 50,000 decisions/month
- Priority support
- Weekly reporting + insights

ENTERPRISE - Custom
- Unlimited domains
- Unlimited decisions
- Dedicated success manager
- Real-time dashboards
```

**Option 2: Domain-First (Show One at a Time)**
```
1. Select your primary domain: [Sales / Product / Education / etc.]
2. See pricing for that specific domain
3. Add additional domains later
```

## Key Principles

1. **Lead with benefits, not technology**
   - Bad: "Evolutionary algorithms"
   - Good: "Learns what works and does more of it"

2. **Use concrete numbers**
   - Bad: "Significant improvement"
   - Good: "20-40% cost reduction"

3. **Speak customer language**
   - Bad: "Optimize conversion patterns"
   - Good: "Get more customers from the same traffic"

4. **Answer "So what?"**
   - Every technical feature needs a benefit translation
   - "Our AI uses genetic algorithms" → So what?
   - "You save 10 hours per week" ← That's why

5. **One idea per section**
   - Don't pile features
   - Pick the most compelling benefit
   - Save others for later pages

## Next Steps

1. Implement Hero rewrite (30 min)
2. Implement Domain description rewrites (45 min)
