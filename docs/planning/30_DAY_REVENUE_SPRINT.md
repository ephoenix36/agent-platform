## 🎯 Product-Market Fit: Top 3 Pilot Scenarios

### 1. Sales Operations: Auto-Qualify + Book Meetings
**Problem:** SDRs spend 6+ hours/week manually qualifying leads  
**Solution:** AI agent qualifies leads, writes outreach, books meetings  
**KPI Target:** Book 10+ qualified meetings/month OR increase MQL→SQL by 15%  
**ROI Calculation:** 6 hrs/week saved × $48/hr × 4.33 weeks = $1,249/month savings  
**Payback Period:** ~5.6 months for $7k pilot

### 2. Support Operations: First-Touch Triage
**Problem:** Support backlog, slow response times, wasted agent hours  
**Solution:** AI triages tickets, auto-resolves simple issues, prioritizes complex ones  
**KPI Target:** Reduce average handle time (AHT) by 10-20% OR clear backlog by 30%  
**ROI Calculation:** 1 FTE worth of time redeployed = $4-8k/month value  
**Payback Period:** 1-2 months for $15k pilot

### 3. Legal/Finance: Contract Review & Redlining
**Problem:** Legal review bottlenecks delay deals  
**Solution:** AI extracts clauses, highlights risks, produces initial redlines  
**KPI Target:** Reduce review cycle time by 30% OR save 20+ reviewer hours/month  
**ROI Calculation:** Faster deal close = higher revenue velocity  
**Payback Period:** 2-3 months for $15k pilot

Hi [Name],

Saw [company] just [raised funding / hired X people / announced Y]. 

Quick question: What's your team currently doing about [specific pain - 
e.g., "qualifying the 500+ inbound leads you're getting monthly"]?

We just built an AI agent that [specific outcome - "auto-qualifies leads 
and books meetings in your reps' calendars"]. 

Helped [similar company] increase booked meetings by 40% in a 4-week pilot.

Worth a 15-min conversation?
```

**Discovery Call Agenda (15 minutes):**
1. **Their current process (5 min):** "Walk me through how you handle [X] today"
2. **Quantify pain (5 min):** "How many hours per week does your team spend on this?"
3. **Demo relevant use case (10 min):** Show the exact workflow they need
4. **ROI calculation:** "If we saved you 20 hours/week at $50/hr, that's $4,300/month..."
5. **Propose pilot:** "Let's run a 4-week pilot. Here's exactly what we'll deliver..."

**Same-Day Proposal Email:**
```
Subject: [Company Name] AI Pilot Proposal - Guaranteed ROI

Hi [Name],

Great connecting today. As discussed, here's the 4-week pilot plan:

**Goal:** [Specific KPI - e.g., "Increase qualified meetings booked by 10+ per month"]

**What we deliver:**
- [3-4 specific deliverables]
- Weekly KPI dashboard
- Human-in-loop escalation
- 2 weeks post-pilot support

**Timeline:** 4 weeks from kickoff
**Investment:** $7,000 ($3,500 due at signature, $3,500 at completion)

Ready to start? [Calendar link for kickoff call]

[Your Name]
```

**Success Metric:** 3-5 pilot proposals sent ($21k-$125k pipeline value)

### Week 3 (Days 15-21): Closing Week

**Priority:** Convert proposals to signed contracts

**Follow-up Cadence:**

- **"Too expensive"** → Show monthly ROI vs pilot cost (should be 2-5x)
- **"Need to think about it"** → "What specifically do you need to evaluate?"
- **"Timing"** → "When should I follow up? Would a smaller scope work now?"
- **"Build vs buy"** → "How long would custom dev take? What's the opportunity cost?"

**Negotiation Guidelines:**
- ✅ Can offer 10-15% discount for immediate signature

### Unit Economics Formulas

**LTV Calculation:**
$$LTV = ARPA \times AvgLifetimeMonths \times GrossMargin$$

**CAC Payback Period:**
$$PaybackMonths = \frac{CAC}{ARPA}$$

**Target Ratios:**
- LTV:CAC ≥ 3:1
- Payback Period < 12 months (prefer < 6)

### Example Calculation
- ARPA = $2,000/mo
- AvgLifetime = 12 months
- Gross Margin = 70%
- **LTV = $2,000 × 12 × 0.7 = $16,800**
- **Acceptable CAC ≤ $5,600 (LTV/CAC = 3)**
- **Ideal CAC ≤ $2,800 (LTV/CAC = 6)**
