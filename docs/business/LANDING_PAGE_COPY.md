## PROBLEM SECTION

### Headline
**Your Sales Team Spends 40% of Time on Research, Not Selling**

### 3 Pain Points (Icon + Text Cards)

**📊 Manual Research Hell**
Hours spent digging through LinkedIn for each prospect. Your team becomes researchers, not closers.

**📧 Generic Outreach Ignored**  
2% response rate because emails aren't personalized. Prospects delete before reading.

**⏰ Slow Follow-Ups Lose Deals**
Interested prospects go cold while waiting for response. Timing kills conversions.

## FAQ SECTION (Accordion)

**Q: How is this different from other sales automation tools?**
A: Most tools just send emails. We do the research too - enriching prospects with pain points, trigger events, and personalization signals. Plus, we classify responses and auto-route follow-ups. It's the complete workflow, not just one piece.

**Q: Will this work with my CRM?**
A: Yes. We integrate with Salesforce, HubSpot, Outreach, Apollo, and most major CRMs. If you use something else, we have webhooks and API access.

**Q: How long does setup take?**
A: White-glove onboarding takes 1-2 days. You upload your prospect list, we configure everything, and your first campaign goes live within 24 hours.

**Q: What if my emails go to spam?**
A: Our Email Deliverability Validator checks every email pre-send and optimizes for 90%+ inbox placement. We use provider-specific rules for Gmail, Outlook, and Apple Mail.

**Q: Can I review emails before they send?**
A: Absolutely. You can run in "approval mode" where you review every email, or "autonomous mode" where AI handles everything. Most customers start with approval mode and switch to autonomous after seeing the quality.

**Q: What's your success rate?**
A: Our average customer sees 3.5% email-to-meeting conversion rate (vs. 2% industry average). That's 75% higher response rate than manual outreach.

**Q: Is this compliant with anti-spam laws?**
A: Yes. We follow CAN-SPAM, GDPR, and CCPA requirements. Unsubscribe links included, opt-outs honored immediately, and no purchased email lists allowed.
