## OUTREACH SEQUENCE

### Email 1: Personalized Value Prop (Day 1)

**Subject Line Options:**
1. `[Name], 15x more meetings for [Company]?`
2. `Quick question about [Company]'s sales process`
3. `[Shared Connection] suggested I reach out`
4. `Saw you're hiring SDRs - timing might be perfect`

**Email Body Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

[PERSONALIZED OPENING - reference their post/trigger event/shared connection]

I'm reaching out because [Company] fits the profile of sales teams we're helping book 15-20x more qualified meetings without hiring more reps.

Here's how it works:
• AI researches prospects (100/hour vs. 5/hour manual)
• Writes personalized outreach for each
• Classifies responses and auto-routes follow-ups

[Current Customer - TechCorp] went from 5 meetings/week to 47 meetings/week with the same team size.

Would a quick 15-min demo make sense? I can show you exactly how this would work for [Company].

[Calendar Link]

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - First 5 customers get 50% off + dedicated success manager. 2 spots left.
```

### Email 2: Value-Add (Day 3 if no response)

**Subject:** `Re: Quick question about [Company]'s sales process`

**Body:**
```
[Name],

Not sure if you saw my previous email, but wanted to share something that might be helpful regardless:

I put together a quick analysis of [Company]'s outreach approach based on your LinkedIn posts. Here's what I found:

[1-2 specific insights from research]
• [Pain point you've mentioned]
• [Opportunity you're missing]

Happy to send over the full analysis if useful - no strings attached.

And if you're curious about how we're helping similar companies book 15x more meetings, here's my calendar: [Link]

Cheers,
[Your Name]
```

---

### Email 3: Break-Up (Day 7 if still no response)

**Subject:** `Should I close your file?`

**Body:**
```
[Name],

I'll take your silence as a "not interested" and won't bother you again.

Quick question though - was it:
A) Not a priority right now?
B) Happy with current process?
C) Emails going to spam? (damn algorithms)

Just curious so I can improve my outreach.

Either way, best of luck hitting your Q4 targets!

[Your Name]

P.S. - If I'm wrong and you ARE interested, here's the link: [Calendar]
