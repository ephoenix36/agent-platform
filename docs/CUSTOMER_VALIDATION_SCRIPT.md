Hi [Name],

I'm working on a project to help [sales teams/climate programs] achieve 
15-75% improvements in [key metric] using AI-powered optimization.

insights, I'll share:

- Early access to the platform (50% discount for beta users)

## 🗣️ **INTERVIEW SCRIPT (20 minutes)**

### Introduction (2 min)

"Thanks for taking the time. As context, I'm building an AI-powered optimization 
platform and want to make sure it actually solves real problems before investing 
months of development.

This will be conversational - I'm here to learn from your experience. Everything 
you share is confidential unless you explicitly say otherwise.

Sound good? [Wait for confirmation]"

### Part 2: Solution Validation (7 min)

**Setup:** "Let me share what we're building and get your reaction..."

**Brief Pitch (60 seconds):**
"We've built an AI system that continuously tests different strategies in 
[their domain], learns what works best for your specific situation, and 
automatically optimizes over time. 

For example, in sales, it might test 50 different email approaches, identify 
the top 3 performers, and focus your team's effort there - leading to 15-75% 
improvement in response rates.

The key difference from typical tools: instead of you manually running A/B 
tests or hiring consultants, the system runs hundreds of experiments 
automatically and continuously improves."
