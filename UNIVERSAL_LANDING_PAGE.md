## FAQ SECTION (Expandable)

**Q: How is this different from other AI optimization tools?**
A: We use evolutionary algorithms proven to beat state-of-the-art in drug discovery (15% better) and TPU optimization (23% gains). Most tools use basic hyperparameter tuning or neural architecture search. We optimize the system itself, not just parameters.

**Q: Do I need to understand AI to use this?**
A: No. Our onboarding wizard guides you through defining what to optimize and how to measure success. The AI handles the complexity. You just upload data and receive results.

**Q: How do I know it will work for my domain?**
A: Email us your challenge. We'll analyze if it meets our criteria (objective eval, fast verify, low noise, continuous reward) and send you a feasibility report within 24 hours. If it's not a good fit, we'll tell you honestly.

**Q: Can I try before I buy?**
A: Yes. We offer a pilot program (50% off first month) and 30-60 day money-back guarantee (depending on domain). If we don't deliver measurable improvement, full refund.

**Q: Is this fully automated or do I need a team?**
A: Onboarding is self-service (guided UI). Optimization runs automatically. Results delivered via email/dashboard. You only need to define success criteria and upload data initially. Ongoing operation is hands-off.

**Q: What if I have a custom use case?**
A: That's our specialty! Email us. We've optimized everything from drug molecules to theorem proofs. If it's evaluatable, we can likely optimize it.

**Q: How long until I see results?**
A: Feasibility analysis: 24 hours. Custom demo: 48 hours. First optimization results: 1 week. Meaningful improvement: 2-4 weeks (depending on complexity).
