## OUTREACH STRATEGY (Faceless Model)

### Email Sequence (Automated)

**Email 1: Problem-Focused**
```
Subject: 15-20% carbon capture efficiency gains?

Hi [Name],

Saw [Company] raised [Amount] to scale carbon capture. Congrats!

Quick question: What's your current capture efficiency vs theoretical max?

Most CCS companies we talk to are stuck at 60-70% efficiency. The gap between current and theoretical is worth millions in carbon credit value.

We've helped climate tech companies optimize capture processes using the same evolutionary AI that beat state-of-the-art in drug discovery (15% better, peer-reviewed).

Would a 15-20% efficiency gain in 6-8 weeks be interesting?

[Watch 3-min demo] or [Email me your current efficiency - I'll send feasibility analysis]

Best,
Climate Optimization Team

**Email 2: Value-Add (3 days later)**
```
Subject: Your carbon capture efficiency analysis

[Name],

Not sure if you saw my email, but I ran some numbers on [Company]'s approach based on your public research.

Quick analysis:
- Theoretical max efficiency: ~95%
- Industry average: 65%
- Your opportunity: 30 percentage point gap = $2M-$5M/year in carbon credits

We've optimized similar chemical processes (molecular design, TPU schedules). Happy to share how it would work for carbon capture - no strings attached.

**Email 3: Break-Up (7 days later)**
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

[Name],

Haven't heard back - taking that as "not interested" or "bad timing."

Quick question: Was it:
A) Not a priority right now
B) Happy with current efficiency
C) Emails going to spam (damn Cloudflare)

Either way, best of luck hitting your 2026 carbon credit targets!
