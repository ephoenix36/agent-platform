Hi {{first_name}},

Haven't heard back after sending your feasibility analysis last week.

I'll assume this means:
A) Not a priority right now
B) Budget got reallocated
C) Went with another solution
D) My emails are going to spam (damn filters!)

Either way, I'll close your file unless I hear otherwise.

Quick favor though - which one was it? (Just curious, helps me improve)

If I'm WRONG and you ARE still interested:
→ Reply "STILL INTERESTED"
→ Or book a call: {{calendar_link}}

Best of luck with {{company}} either way!
