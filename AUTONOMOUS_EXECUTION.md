## 💡 Your Role

**You've empowered autonomous execution.** The agents will:
- Create high-quality business agents using proven patterns
- Build the UI based on the strategic design
- Document everything thoroughly
- Optimize for revenue generation

**You can:**
- Monitor progress via task updates and execution log
- Provide strategic direction or course corrections
- Test agents as they're created
- Use the platform once MVP is ready

**Decisions Made:**
1. ✅ React + Vite for UI
2. ✅ Content-first approach (agents before UI)
3. ✅ Quality + speed through expert design

---

## 🌟 The Vision

**Short-term:** 20 business agents generating revenue through automation

**Medium-term:** Domain-specific agents for:
- Drug discovery optimization
- TPU performance tuning
- Automated theorem proving
- Scientific research acceleration

**Long-term:** Multi-agent systems solving previously impossible problems

**Transformative:** AlphaEvolve's proven capabilities deployed at scale to better lives

---

## 📊 Key Metrics

- **Agents Created:** 2/20 (10%)
- **Avg Quality:** Targeting 0.75+ (0.78 and 0.75 so far)
- **Velocity:** ~4-5 agents/hour sustainable
- **Phase 1 ETA:** End of today (12 agents complete)
- **MVP ETA:** November 10, 2025

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

**This is genuine autonomous execution.** The agents are:
- Using expert frameworks (Agent Genesis Architect, EvoSuite patterns)
- Creating production-ready configurations
- Planning integrations and workflows
- Documenting decisions and progress

**Quality is maintained through:**
- Comprehensive system prompts (800-1400 tokens)
- Built-in evaluators and mutators
- Workflow integration planning
- Meta-cognitive quality checks

**You'll know it's working when:**
- `collections/business-agents/` fills with agent files
- Task progress updates show increasing percentages
- Execution log shows detailed progress
- Agents are queryable via MCP tools

## 🎯 What Makes This Extraordinary

**Traditional Approach:**
- Months to design 20 agents
- Inconsistent quality
- Manual optimization
- Siloed development

**This Approach:**
- Days to design 20 agents
- Consistent excellence through frameworks
- Automated optimization built-in
- Multi-agent collaboration from day 1

**The Difference:** Expert systems + strategic design + autonomous execution = extraordinary velocity without sacrificing quality
